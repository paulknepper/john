Script to share with John

Push commits to john.git (origin): git push origin master

Three ways to call johnstock at command line; python version assumed to be
3.x:

1. $ python johnstock.py

This will interact with the user to ask for a valid ticker symbol, and will
pull stock data from later of Jan 1, 1940 and stock IPO date.  Note the 
use of 1/1/1940 is arbitrary.

2. $ python johnstock.py <ticker>

This will automatically retrive data for <ticker> as far back as the later
of Jan 1, 1940 and the stock's IPO date.

3. $ python johnstock.py -t <ticker>

The -t flag tells the script to only pull stock data for today.
